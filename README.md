# 🌿 PohLang — The Language of Purpose and Clarity

**PohLang** is an open-source programming language and ecosystem built with one belief:

> **Technology should be clear, purposeful, and ethical.**

We’re building more than a language — we’re building a *community* that values simplicity, honesty, and innovation.  
Whether you’re a developer, writer, designer, or educator — PohLang welcomes you.

## 🌍 Our Vision

PohLang was born from a simple idea:  
to create a human-centred language that balances technical power with moral clarity.

We believe software should:
- Empower people, not exploit them.  
- Be transparent, not manipulative.  
- Encourage learning, not dependence.  

Every line of code in PohLang carries this vision.

## 🤝 The PohLang Community

This organization represents the official **PohLang Community Initiative** —  
a volunteer-driven ecosystem united by a shared purpose:  
to design, document, and grow PohLang for the benefit of all.

Our community includes:
- 💻 **Developers** – improving the compiler, libraries, and tools.  
- 🧩 **Designers** – shaping user experiences and educational materials.  
- 🌐 **Translators** – making PohLang accessible to everyone.  
- 📚 **Writers** – crafting tutorials, guides, and documentation.  
- 📢 **Ambassadors** – sharing PohLang across platforms and communities.  

> Everyone has a place here — if you value clarity, creativity, and community, you belong.
